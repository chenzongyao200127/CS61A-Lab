# Project 2: CS 61A Autocorrected Typing Software

> Programmers dream of Abstraction, recursion, and Typing really fast.

# Introduction

In this project, you will write a program that measures typing speed. Additionally, you will implement typing autocorrect, which is a feature that attempts to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it. This project is inspired by typeracer.**

When students in the past have tried to implement the functions without thoroughly reading the problem description, theyâ€™ve often run into issues. ðŸ˜± Read each description thoroughly before starting to code.

# Final Product
Our staff solution to the project can be interacted with at cats.cs61a.org. If you'd like, feel free to try it out now. When you finish the project, you'll have implemented a significant part of this yourself!

# Download Starter Files
You can download all of the project code as a zip archive. This project includes several files, but your changes will be made only to cats.py. Here are the files included in the archive:

cats.py: The typing test logic.
utils.py: Utility functions for interacting with files and strings.
ucb.py: Utility functions for CS 61A projects.
data/sample_paragraphs.txt: A file containing text samples to be typed. These are scraped Wikipedia articles about various subjects.
data/common_words.txt: A file containing common English words in order of frequency.
data/words.txt: A file containing many more English words in order of frequency.
data/final_diff_words.txt: A file containing even more English words!
cats_gui.py: A web server for the web-based graphical user interface (GUI).
gui_files: A directory of files needed for the graphical user interface (GUI).
multiplayer: A directory of files needed to support multiplayer mode.
favicons: A directory of icons.
